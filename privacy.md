# Privacy Policy
The Site is operated by Juiiicy, LLC. ("Juiiicy" or the "Company").
This page sets forth the Privacy Policy (the "Policy") for the website at juiiicy.com, all other sites owned and operated by Juiiicy that redirect to juiiicy.com, and all subdomains (collectively, the “Site”), and the service owned and operated by the Company (together with the Site, the “Service”)

We take the responsibility of having your personal information very seriously. We use your personal information only for providing and improving the Service. We treat your personal information as we would and do treat our own.
By using the Service, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.

The Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Policy by posting the updated version on the Site. It is your responsibility to check this Policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.

## Collection of Information
We may collect and process the following information about you:

information that you provide by completing forms on the Site;
your log-in and password details in connection with the account sign-in process;
communications between "Client" and "Freelancer";
details of any requests or transactions made by you through the Service;
IP addresses.

## Uses of Your Personal Information
We will use the personal information you provide to:

identify you when you sign-in to your account;
enable us to provide you with the Services;
administer your account with us;
enable us to contact you regarding any question you make through the Service;
analyze the use of the Service and the people visiting to improve our content and Services; and
use for other purposes that we may disclose to you when we request your information.

## Email
We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. You will receive certain email notifications according to your use of the "Site" (posting a new "Job", sending an application etc.).
We may send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.

## Wrap-up
Juiiicy reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or in the good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with the law.
To modify or delete the personal information you have provided to us, please log in and update your profile. We may retain certain information as required by law or for necessary business purposes.
On request, we will give you a copy of all the personal information about you that we hold. This information is subject to a fee not exceeding the prescribed fee permitted by law.

People under 18 (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) are not permitted to use Juiiicy on their own, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for their use of the site.
Information that you submit through the Service may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to provide the Service to you. For example, our servers are in the United States. If we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.
